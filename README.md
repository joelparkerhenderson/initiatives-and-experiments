# Initiatives and experiments

Initiatives are special projects where work is well-understood.

Experiments are special projects where work involves testing hypotheses, validating learning, and generating new knowledge.

* Initiatives and experiements are mapped to strategic objectives.

* The mapping is in order to give an indication of the projects and actions that are needed in order to realize the objectives.

Use systems thinking to identify cause-and-effect relationships among all the initiatives and experiments:

 * Systems thinking represents the combined power of all the teams' high-level perception of the business model.

* Systems thinking helps ensure objectives are mutually supportive.

Use SMART criteria:

* Specific

* Measurable

* Actionable

* Relevant

* Timely
